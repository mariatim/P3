Medialogy project, semester 3. 

How can we create a visual artistic installation with an interactive particle system (flocks

of underwater organisms) using dice recognition as an interface? The focus of the instal-
lation is to provoke thinking in the visitors of Copenhagen Contemporary and to convey

a message about the human impact on marine ecosystems.
